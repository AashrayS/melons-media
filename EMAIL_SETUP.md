## 🔧 How to Set Up Email Notifications

### Option 1: EmailJS (Easiest - Frontend Only)

1. **Sign up at EmailJS.com**
   - Create account at https://emailjs.com
   - Create email service (Gmail/Outlook/etc.)
   - Create email template

2. **Install EmailJS**
   ```bash
   npm install @emailjs/browser
   ```

3. **Update the lead magnet code**
   - Uncomment EmailJS code in `src/lib/leadMagnet.ts`
   - Add your service ID, template ID, and public key

4. **Email Template Example:**
   ```

   ```

### Option 2: Backend with Nodemailer

1. **Create API endpoint** (Express.js example):
   ```javascript
   app.post('/api/lead-magnet', async (req, res) => {
     const { email } = req.body;
     
     // Save to database
     await saveLeadToDatabase(email);
     
     // Send notification
     await sendNotificationEmail(email);
     
     res.json({ success: true });
   });
   ```

2. **Update frontend** to call your API instead of local storage

### Option 3: Third-party Services

**ConvertKit:**
- Sign up at convertkit.com
- Use their API to subscribe leads
- Set up automation sequences

**Mailchimp:**
- Use Mailchimp API
- Automatic email sequences
- Advanced analytics

## 📱 Current PDF Download Process

1. User enters email
2. Email gets validated and stored locally
3. PDF opens in new tab with print dialog
4. User can "Save as PDF" from browser

## 🚀 Production Recommendations

1. **Email Service**: Use EmailJS for quick setup or ConvertKit for advanced features
2. **PDF Generation**: Use Puppeteer on backend for true PDF files
3. **Analytics**: Track conversion rates and follow-up success
4. **Automation**: Set up email sequences for lead nurturing

## 📊 Tracking Emails

Current emails are stored in:
- Browser localStorage (development)
- Will log to console when downloaded

To view captured emails:
```javascript
// In browser console:
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('leadMagnetEmails'))
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Choose email service (EmailJS recommended for quick start)
2. Set up email templates
3. Test the complete flow
4. Monitor conversion rates
5. Create follow-up email sequence
