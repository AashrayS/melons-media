- Each mascot placement has unique hover animations to add personality

- Strategic placement above headings for maximum brand impact
- Responsive sizing for mobile and desktop
- Alt text for accessibility: "Melons Media Mascot"

The mascot serves as a consistent brand element that reinforces the company's bold, fun, and professional personality across all pages while maintaining visual hierarchy and user experience.
